libb64-2: RFC4648 Base64 Encoding/Decoding Routines
======================================

Requirements:
------------
This piece of software has minimal requirements.

I have tested it on the following systems:

- a Linux machine, with the following specs:
(this was the original development machine)
	* FedoraCore 4
	* kernel v. 2.6.11 (stock FC4 kernel)
	* gcc version 4.0.1 20050727 (Red Hat 4.0.1-5)
	* glibc-2.3.5-10
	* make v. 3.80
	* some arb version of makedepend

- Ubuntu 12.4 LTS

- Windows XP machine
	* MSYS 1.0
	* MinGW 5.1.4
	* gcc version 3.4.5 (mingw-vista special r3)

- Windows XP machine (same as above)
	* Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, Version 10.0.30319.1 RTMRel

- Windows 7
    * Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008
	
Barring any serious screwups on my part, this code should compile and run sweetly
under Cygwin and other systems too. If you DO get it running under some weird arch/os setup,
send me a mail, please.

Compiling:
---------
For the library:
Include b64/<header> as appropriate for your application into your C or C++ sources.
(e.g. #include <b64/cencode.h>)
Add -I<include/path> to your CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS. That's it.  
If you copy the b64/ directory into your source tree, you only need to use a quoted
include, e.g. #include "b64/decode.hpp".  No -I options are necessary.


For the base64 executable:
There is no configure. Run make in the root directory. You'll find the base64 binary
in the base64/ directory.

Installing:
----------
Since the current targets are a standalone executable and a header library, an install
script has not been implemented yet. Simply copy the executable into your path, and use it.

Copy the include/b64 directory somewhere sane, like /usr/local/include.  It's recommended
you copy the entire b64/ directory structure to the install path, not just the headers.
